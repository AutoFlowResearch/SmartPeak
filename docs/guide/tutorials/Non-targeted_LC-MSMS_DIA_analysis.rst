Non-targeted analysis using LC-MS/MS DIA acquisition
----------------------------------------------------

This tutorial walks you through the workflow for analyzing non-targeted liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data-independent acquisition (DIA) 
data starting from input file generation, to processing the data in SmartPeak, 
to reviewing the data in SmartPeak, to reporting the results.

Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~

#. Obtaining the SOP for the workflow.
#. Choosing a data set for demonstrating the workflow.
#. Creating an optimized SmartPeak input templates for running the workflow.

The Workflows include
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Defining the transition library
#. Processing Unknowns
#. Reviewing the results

.. todo::
    The rest of the tutorial.

.. warning::
    SmartPeak supports metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics DIA workflows. Please contact us if you are interested in including your dataset as an example.
