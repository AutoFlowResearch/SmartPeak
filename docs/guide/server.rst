Using SmartPeak Server
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This page describes the remote server for scaling SmartPeak to large and computationally demanding workflows using high performance computing (HPC) resources. 
The SmartPeak Server utilizes containerization and gRPC to enable users to connect, control, and view a remote session using the SmartPeak GUI.  
An IT administrator would most likely be required to set-up the remote server on the HPC resources and ensure file transfer and security are in place.
The SmartPeak team maintains containerized versions of the SmartPeak `CLI<https://hub.docker.com/r/autoflowresearch/smartpeak-cli>`_ and `Server<https://hub.docker.com/r/autoflowresearch/smartpeak-server>`_ on DockerHub that are required for setting up the workers and server, respectively.
