Using SmartPeak
=============================================================================

SmartPeak comes in different flavors to satisfy users' needs. The SmartPeakGUI is ideal for most usecases since it offers an
easy-to-use graphical user interface, advanced plotting capabilities and session saving and restoring, while the commandline
version offers fast and easy to use data processing from a PC or a remote server with abundant computational resources. For
larger data processing piplines, SmartPeak Team is offering a light weight yet powerful SmartPeakServer which can be deployed
to a HPC cluster to perform larger computations and connected remotely to SmartPeakGUI for a seamless user experience.
