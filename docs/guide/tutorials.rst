This section covers a breadth of walkthroughs using different datasets and analytical techniques.


Targeted quantitation with HPLC data
------------------------------------

This tutorial walks you through the workflow for analyzing targeted HPLC data starting from input file generation, 
to processing the data in SmartPeak, to reviewing the data in SmartPeak, to reporting the results for later use.

Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~

#. How to obtain the SOP for the workflow [!]
#. Choosing a small example data set for demonstrating the workflow
#. Creating an optimized SmartPeak input templates for running the workflow
#. TODO:Create the example if it does not already exist in the SmartPeak Repo. If the example does exist, please ensure that the templates are the most up to date
#. TODO:Create the pre-defined workflow step defaults in SmartPeak if they do not already exist.  If the workflow defaults do exist, please ensure that they are the most up to date

The Workflows include
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Calculating the calibration curves using Standards
#. Processing Unknowns

Steps
~~~~~

The tutorial includes the following steps

#. Setting up the input files
#. Defining the workflow in SmartPeak
#. Running the workflow in SmartPeak
#. Reviewing the data in SmartPeak
#. Reporting the results
#. Trouble shooting
