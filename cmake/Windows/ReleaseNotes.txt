Congratulations!  You have successfully installed SmartPeak.

"TOPP" is an acronym for "The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline".  It consists of
several small applications that can be chained to create analysis pipelines
tailored for a specific problem.

Note that the Windows binary release is meant for end-users only, rather than
for developers who want to contribute algorithms.  Developers should download
the source code version (see http://www.SmartPeak.com for details).
